# FastAPI Project

This is a backend API project built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

## Features

- FastAPI-based RESTful API
- Automatic interactive API docs (Swagger UI & ReDoc)
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Async support

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pip

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/tahiralatif/Q4-Learning/tree/main/02_FastAPI/fastapi>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create and Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     uv venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     uv venv
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   Note: With PEP 582 support (Python 3.11+), uv may not require manual activation for running commands.

3. **Add Dependencies:**
   We'll need FastAPI and Uvicorn (ASGI server):
   ```bash
   uv add "fastapi[standard]"
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- The API will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- Interactive API docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- Alternative docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

## How to Use This README

### What is a README.md File?

A `README.md` file is a markdown document that serves as the front page of your project. It provides essential information about your project, including:

- **Project Overview**: A brief description of what your project does.
- **Features**: Key functionalities or features of your project.
- **Requirements**: Prerequisites needed to run the project (e.g., Python version, dependencies).
- **Installation Instructions**: Step-by-step guide on how to set up the project.
- **Usage Instructions**: How to run the application and access its features.
- **Project Structure**: A brief overview of the files and directories in your project.
- **License**: Information about the project's licensing.

### How to Use the README.md

1. **Customize the Content**:
   - Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.
   - Update the project structure to reflect the actual files and directories in your project.
   - Add any additional sections that might be relevant (e.g., database setup, environment variables).

2. **Clarity and Conciseness**:
   - Keep the language simple and clear.
   - Use bullet points and code blocks to make instructions easy to follow.

3. **Keep It Updated**:
   - As your project evolves, update the `README.md` to reflect changes in features, installation steps, or usage instructions.

### Benefits of a Good README.md

- **Onboarding**: Helps new users or contributors quickly understand what your project is about and how to get started.
- **Documentation**: Serves as a quick reference for users to understand the project's features and how to use them.
- **Professionalism**: A well-maintained `README.md` reflects professionalism and attention to detail, making your project more attractive to potential users or contributors.
